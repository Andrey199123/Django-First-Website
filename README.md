# My First Django Website

This is the first website I ever created using Django, back when I was in 6th grade. It includes basic functionality such as routing, models, admin customization, and simple views.

This Django app includes:
- Basic URL routing
- Custom models defined in `models.py`
- Admin site customization in `admin.py`
- Views for rendering templates and handling HTTP requests
- Core configuration in `settings.py` and `urls.py`

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Django Framework
- HTML/CSS 
- SQLite

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
4. Install Django
```bash
pip install django
```
6. Start the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
8. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
